## Biography

Hi, I’m Jason Scruggs! I’m a senior at UCLA studying Statistics and Data Science with a minor in Art History. I’m passionate about finding stories in data and exploring how we can use those insights to make smarter decisions.

I’ve been lucky to work with some amazing teams, from helping LA28 shape their marketing strategies to diving into production analytics at Heritage Cabinets. On campus, I get to combine my love for UCLA with storytelling as a Lead Tour Guide, sharing the university with thousands of visitors.

Outside of work and school, I keep busy with surfing, writing and performing comedy, and planning events like a bike-powered music festival. Whether it’s through data, creativity, or community, I’m always looking for ways to connect and make an impact.
