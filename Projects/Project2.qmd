## [Nicotine vs Short Term Memory](Finalpaper102b.pdf)

Motivation and Objectives
The resurgence of nicotine use and its potential effects on short-term memory motivated this study. With conflicting results from prior research—some suggesting nicotine enhances memory, while others indicate no effect or negative consequences—our study aimed to clarify nicotine's impact on immediate recall. We also investigated whether different forms of nicotine administration (cigarettes, inhalers, and tablets) yielded varying effects. The ultimate goal was to contribute to public health knowledge, aiding both prevention and treatment of nicotine addiction.

Methods and Experimental Design
We employed a randomized complete block design with one treatment factor (type of nicotine administration: cigarettes, inhalers, tablets, or control) and three blocking variables (age, sex, and island of origin). Participants memorized a list of 20 words, took the assigned nicotine treatment, and then completed a second memory test. This difference in memory test scores served as the response variable. By blocking on demographic factors, we aimed to reduce variability and improve the precision of our results. The study included 268 participants, exceeding the calculated sample size needed for adequate statistical power.

Statistical Analysis
A one-way ANOVA was performed to determine whether nicotine treatments significantly influenced short-term memory. The residual diagnostics confirmed the model's appropriateness, showing normality and homoscedasticity of errors. Boxplots were used to visualize the effects of treatments and blocking variables on memory scores.

Results
The results revealed no significant effect of nicotine treatments on short-term memory. The p-values for all treatments and blocking variables (age, sex, and island of origin) exceeded 0.4, and the R² value was a negligible 0.017. These findings were consistent across diagnostic plots and boxplots, which showed no meaningful differences in memory test scores among treatment groups or blocking variables.

Discussion and Future Directions
Our findings suggest that nicotine, regardless of its form, does not significantly impact short-term memory. This aligns with some prior studies but contradicts others, highlighting the need for further research. Limitations of our study include the use of a single memory test, potential variability in nicotine metabolism among participants, and uncontrolled external factors such as the time of day tests were administered. Future research should employ a broader range of cognitive assessments and incorporate biomarkers to better understand nicotine's physiological effects.

By addressing these limitations, future studies can build on our findings to develop a more nuanced understanding of nicotine's role in cognitive processes, ultimately informing public health strategies.
